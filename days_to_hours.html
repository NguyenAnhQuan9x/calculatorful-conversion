        <h2>How to convert Days to Hours</h2>
        <p>
            The Earth rotates once in a full cycle every 24 hours, which is equivalent to one day. Therefore, a day is equal to 24 hours.
            The formula for is:
        </p>
        <p><span id="formula">hours = days x 24</span></p>
        <p>
            For example, Let's use the formula to convert 12 days to hr
        </p>
        <p>
            Placing the values in the first formula, we get:
        </p>
        <p>
            hours = 12 x 24 = 288
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, if we convert 12 days to hr, we get 288 hour
        </p>
