            First of all, you should know a little about the history of day and minutes
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="note">Day</span> is the amount of time needed for the Earth to complete one complete rotation around its axis. The time value is rounded up to 24 hours and is standardized. 
            As a result, a day generally lasts 86,400 seconds. A day, denoted by the sign d, is the unit of time as it is used in the SI system. This unit is utilized extensively in a wide range 
            of situations, from daily living to scientific requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="note">Minutes</span> is a unit of time, used widely around the world beyond just the time measuring purposes (i.e. for defying time standards, time zones, etc.). 
            According to the standards, a minute is equal to 60 seconds, or 1/60th of an hour. The symbol for this time unit is min. A minute is also used as a unit of measuring angle 
            widely used in geometry, astronomy, and other branches of science.

        <h2>How to convert Days to Minutes</h2>
        <p>
            In order to do this day to minute conversion yourself, you may need to know the formula used by the time converter so we are providing it below for you to use. 
            For instance, 5 days = 7,200 mins and 12 days = 17,280 mins
        </p>
        <p><span id="formula">minutes = days x 1440</span></p>
        <p>
            For example, Let's use the formula to convert 22 days to minutes
        </p>
        <p>
            Placing the values in the first formula, we get:
        </p>
        <p>
            minutes = 22 x 1440 = 31,680
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, if we convert 22 days to minutes, we get 31,680 minutes
        </p>
