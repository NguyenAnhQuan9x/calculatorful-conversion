            We utilize the lengths of days and weeks to record time and organize our lives in calendars and everywhere else we go. We must understand how to use both of these time units because we use them both on a daily basis. 
            Days are used to refer to a more recent time period, whereas weeks can be used to refer to a period of time that is both more distant in the past and more distant in the future. One of the various time converters

        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="note">Day</span> is the amount of time needed for the Earth to complete one complete rotation around its axis. The time value is rounded up to 24 hours and is standardized. 
            As a result, a day generally lasts 86,400 seconds. A day, denoted by the sign d, is the unit of time as it is used in the SI system. This unit is utilized extensively in a wide range 
            of situations, from daily living to scientific requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="note">Week</span> is a time unit equal to seven days. It is the standard time period used for cycles of rest days in most parts of the world, mostly alongside—although not strictly part of—the Gregorian calendar.
        <h2>How to convert Days to Weeks</h2>
        <p>
            A more conventional method is to divide the number of days by the number of days in a week, which is seven. It can be further developed as follows:
        </p>
        <p>To convert from days to weeks, you can do in 3 steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Take the length of time in days, for example, 90 days</li>
            <li>Divide it by 7, since one week is equal to 7 days</li>
            <li>That’s it! The above division gives us the result in weeks, which is 12.857143 weeks</li>
        </ul>
