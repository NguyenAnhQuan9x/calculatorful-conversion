            that an hour is equal to 3,600 seconds (according to the Universal Coordinated Time, every hour has so called leap second which can be either negative or positive). An hour is a unit accepted 
            and widely used by all countries of the world, and it has got a symbol of h.
        </p>

            <span id="note">Minutes</span> is a unit of time, used widely around the world beyond just the time measuring purposes (i.e. for defying time standards, time zones, etc.). 
            According to the standards, a minute is equal to 60 seconds, or 1/60th of an hour. The symbol for this time unit is min. A minute is also used as a unit of measuring angle

        <h2>How to convert Hours to Minutes</h2>
        <p>
            In order to do this hours to minutes conversion yourself, you may need to know the formula used by the time converter so we are providing it below for you to use. 
            For instance, 5 hours = 300 m  and 12 hours = 720 m
        </p>
        <p><span id="formula">minutes = hours x 60</span></p>
        <p>
            For example, Let's use the formula to convert 28 hours to minutes
        </p>
        <p>
            Placing the values in the first formula, we get:
        </p>
        <p>
            minutes = 28 x 60 = 1680
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, if we convert 28 hours to minutes, we get 1680 m
