            First of all, you should know a little about the history of hours and seconds
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="note">Hour</span> is one of the commonly used units of measuring time, along with a second and a day. One hour is equal to 60 minutes, however, it will not be true to assume 
            that an hour is equal to 3,600 seconds (according to the Universal Coordinated Time, every hour has so called leap second which can be either negative or positive). An hour is a unit accepted 
            and widely used by all countries of the world, and it has got a symbol of h.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="note">Seconds</span> is one of the fundamental time units in the SI. A second is now defined in terms of the time it takes for the Earth to revolve around the Sun, 
            whereas in ancient times it was defined in terms of the length of a solar day. Atomic, electric, and mechanical methods can all be used to measure a second. A second is often 
            denoted by the letter s and is equal to 1/60th of an hour.
        </p>
        <h2>How to convert Hours to Seconds</h2>
        <p>
            In order to do this hours to seconds conversion yourself, you may need to know the formula used by the time converter so we are providing it below for you to use. 
            For instance, 5 hours = 18,000 s  and 12 hours = 43,200 s
        </p>
        <p><span id="formula">seconds = hours x 3600</span></p>
        <p>
            For example, Let's use the formula to convert 22 hours to seconds
        </p>
        <p>
            Placing the values in the first formula, we get:
        </p>
        <p>
            seconds = 22 x 3600 = 79,200
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, if we convert 22 hours to seconds, we get 79,200 s
        </p>
