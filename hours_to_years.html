        <h2>How to convert Hours to Years</h2>
        <p>
            In order to do this hours to years conversion yourself, you may need to know the formula used by the time converter so we are providing it below for you to use. 
            For instance, 126 hours = 0.014384 years  and 268 hours = 0.030594 years

            For example, Let's use the formula to convert 228 hours to years
        </p>
        <p>
            Placing the values in the first formula, we get:
        </p>
        <p>
            years = 228 / 8760 = 0.026027
