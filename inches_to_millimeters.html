        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="note">An inches</span> is a unit of measurement that adheres to the American Standard. One foot is equivalent to twelve inches. A further division into smaller units follows the inch. One inch is divided into 16 units. One-sixteenth of an inch (1/16 inch) is the size of each unit. 
            These 16 tiny units are combined into a larger unit called an inch, which is made up of 2/16ths (which is mathematically equivalent to an eighth). These two 1/8th units are 1/4 inch wide (also commonly called a quarter of an inch). 
            Again, two of these quarter-inch divisions equal one inch (two quarters are mathematically reduced to one inch). Next, three units of 1/4 inch (often referred to as "three quarters of an inch") equal 3/8. Finally, 1 inch is equivalent to 4 1/4th units.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="note">Millimeters</span> is one the most commonly used units of length which equals to 1/1000th of a meter. It is a unit of SI applicable for measuring small distances and small length. According to SI rules, the unit symbol is mm.

            Placing the values in the first formula, we get:
        </p>
        <p>
            mm = 26 x 25.4 = 660.4
