            1 cup is the unit approved by the Imperial system and the US customary system, and it is equal to 250 milliliters. There are actually a 
            few types of cups sued around the world, including the US legal cup, Imperial cup, Japanese cup, etc., and they all are different in terms of the value.

        <p>
            <span id="note">An Ounces</span> known  as the US fluid ounce, the unit of volume for liquid substances is used as ounce in the US and other countries practicing the US Customary system. 
            It is equals to approximately 1/8 of US cup, 1/16 of US pint, approximately 1.040842731 Imperial Fluid Ounces, 2 tablespoons or 6 teaspoons.

        <h2>How to convert ounces to cups?</h2>
        <p>
            To convert one measurement from ounces to cups, you can use the below formula:
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="formula">cups = ounces / 8.345404 x material density</span><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The above formula can be hard to understand so let’s follow an example. You want to convert 15 ounces to cups with an ingredient density of 1 g/ml:<br>
            15 ounces = 15 / 8.345404 x 1 = 1.7973965 cups
        </p>
