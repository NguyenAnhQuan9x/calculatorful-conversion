            First things first: here are the most basic facts you should know about tons.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you live in the US, you are looking at a measurement of mass when you come across a reference to a ton.
            Following are conversions from <a href="https://www.calculatorful.com/tons-to-pounds">tons to pounds</a>:
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="formula">1 ton = 2000 pounds</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            But what if you dig a little deeper into this unit? Let’s check out some other kinds of tons around the
            world.
        </p>
        <p>One of the reasons the ton is such a confounding measurement is that there are actually three different kinds
            of tons in use around the world.</p>
        <h2>Short Ton</h2>
        <p>
            The metric system of measurement has never been used in the United States. Our nation substitutes a system
            known as conventional units.
            This approach employs tons as well as the pounds and ounces I mentioned in the previous section to measure
            mass.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="formula">The US ton is called a short ton. 1 short ton is 2000 pounds.</span>
        </p>
        <h2>Long Ton</h2>
        <p>
            The metric system and the more antiquated Imperial system are both used in the United Kingdom.
            This implies that they sometimes measure mass in kilograms and other times in what are known as stones.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ton that is used in Imperial measures is a little heavier than the US one, so the UK ton is called a
            long ton.
            <span id="formula">1 long ton is 2240 pounds.</span>
        </p>
        <h2>Tonne (or Metric Ton)</h2>
        <p>
            Most other countries have by this point fully adopted the metric system, and use grams and kilograms to
            measure mass.
        </p>
        <p>
            The metric ton is never officially called a metric ton, and is instead called a tonne (pronounced just like
            the word “ton”).
            <span id="formula">1 tonne is 1000 kilograms, or 2,204.6 pounds.</span>
        </p>
        <h2>How to convert tons to pounds?</h2>
